            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WITH permission, reader, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you the particulars of my life, and as but few persons, I fancy, ever experienced more difficulties, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be in my power to entertain you.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The Negro boy advised me to turn the boat and follow him, but as we had so providentially escaped being devoured, I thought it not proper to run into more danger than was necessary, so I 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:019599_0010_0FAC5F4884475E10"/>
ordered him to keep his course, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly loaded my gun again, for there was plenty of ammunition in the boat: We now felt the want of nothing but fresh water, and that article we were horridly distressed for. I was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleased with the lad, for he cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offered to go on shore with a great pitcher, and try to find some, but by no means would I suffer that until we had made the boat fast, and I was ready to go along with my two guns; we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled full a mile up the country, and at last were fortunate enough to meet with an excellent spring; we were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pitcher, when on a sudden, the lad cried, <hi>see, Massa, see,</hi> I turned round, and at about fifty yards dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, under a tree, sat the greatest Lion my eyes ever beheld, just on the point of darting at us; my guns I had laid on the grass, but instantly snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the nearest, fired, and sound I had wounded him. It was lucky I had two guns with me, else I had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lived to have related these strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:019599_0011_0FAC5F4943E302A8"/>
for, instead of the Lion's running away, after I wounded him, he jumped from the tree, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est anger, towards us, and I had but just time to level the second gun which dispatched him.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>I was very thankful to God for my wonderful escape, and having found what we went on shore for, proceeded
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:019599_0012_0FAC5F4B620DE540"/>
to make the utmost haste to the boat. We sailed along until at length we met with a Portuguese ship, which took us on board. The Captain bought the boat and the boy of me, and landed me at the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils, where I hired a plantation and lived comfortably for some time, but was again tempted to go to sea, in a ship bound for the Guinea trade. We kept sailing on, quite ignorant where going to, until the most dreadful storm surrounded us, surely, which ever man beheld; in a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes the sky turned black as night, though half an hour before the sun told me it was noon, the sea rolled mountains high, every instant we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be our last, one moment we were lifted on the top of a wave five times higher than St. PAUL'S, and the next plunged as low. At last we got out the boat, exhausted with fatigue, several were washed overboard and lost. I was too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated to admit a single thought respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, for in a few minutes afterwards the boat went to the bottom. The first thing I recollect, was lying on the shore,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:019599_0013_0FAC5F4C1F871738"/>
and seeing the water roll towards me and taking me about a mile into the sea; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wave would bring me on shore, and leave me there a minute or two; then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other took me out to sea again; in this manner was I suspended between life and death, until a very large wave, driving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to shore, carried me so far on the sands, that the next did not touch me, and the storm abating, there was I left, until by degrees I recovered the use of my reason, and the first act, I applied it to, was to thank God my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. When the storm abated, I saw the wreck of the ship at a distance, and swam to it, and brought off a dog, which was the only thing alive on board, two guns, and many necessaries.</p>
            <p>Though I had so wonderfully escaped the dangers of the ocean, I now had the fear of wild beasts before me, a proof this life is intended only as a life of trouble, for I am fully persuaded, none living, let their fortunes, friends, healths, &amp;c, be ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so extensive and valuable, can truly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert they are now perfectly happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:019599_0014_0FAC5F4D1F1A0940"/>
When I had recovered strength to rise, I walked into the country, and had got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three miles from the sea, without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing but goats, hares, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense number of wild fowls, when reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very high hill, I there had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of viewing the country. I found it to be an island about ten miles long, five broad, and very woody; an hundred gloomy ideas presented themselves at this instant, I began to fancy Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served me from the dangers of the water, only to torture me with a more cruel and tedious death; but this reflexion I was angry at, so I jumped from the ground, and with a thought full of industry, said God has done such wonderful kindnesses for me, it is infamous and ungrateful in me to complain; here are fowls, goats, and hares in abundance, and it is strange if I cannot hunt for food; all I have to pray for, is, that it is not inhabited by wild creatures who will devour me, which thank God, was not the case.</p>
            <p>No human creature but myself was on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:019599_0015_0FAC5F4DC31590E8"/>
the island, or any offensive animal to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest me. On this island I lived fifteen years, subsisting the whole time on milk, (for I had caught some young goats, and brought them up tame) and what fowls I took in the woods, by laying springs and traps in the night. One day, about noon, going into the woods after some of my bird traps, I thought I should have sunk to the ground, through fear, every joint of me trembled at the sight, it was the print of a man's foot. Good God! O! what did I see, I was confident it was not the mark of my own, for besides it being a deal larger, I had not been in that part for a month, and that print was quite fresh. I ran like lightning to my home, which was a kind of cave, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with trees, and threw myself down on a parcel of dry leaves, which for some years, had served me as a bed, there I lay three days and nights, without a morsel of food or sleep, so distressed was I at discov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering there was on the island, more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creatures than myself, who, I feared, would murder me; hunger at last obliged
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:019599_0016_0FAC5F4E857BCF00"/>
me to look for food, and surely never poor creature ventured out of his hiding place so fearfully, as I did out of my cave.</p>
            <p>I was terrified at every leaf that moved, but having no further reason to fancy my fears well-grounded, I concluded the mark was from my own foot, so was tolerably easy; but soon afterwards I was thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the contrary, for ranging through the woods, as was my usual cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, for food, I discovered one day five canoes full of savages, within half a league of the shore, and making to it as fast as they possibly could. I secreted myself near enough to discover what they were about, and found the canoes landed all the Indians, but two of them were chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, who cried piteously; they presently made a large fire, cut the throat of one of the two, broiled his flesh on the fire, and eat it; never did I behold a sight which filled me with horrour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to this, however, shocked as I was, prudence kept me quiet. When they had eat as much of the poor creature as they chose, they were preparing to dispatch the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:019599_0017_0FAC5F4F64121D98"/>
other, but just as they had unbound him, and going to give the finishing stroke, by the greatest agility I ever beheld, he slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped under their arms, and run into the woods; he made towards the place where I lay concealed, and on that account I was alarmed for my own safety; three of the savages I saw follow him, and as I knew nothing but a stout resistance on my part could be of service, I took care to have my guns loaded and in order to receive them; presently the savage who was to have been roasted, came running quite out of breath, he was ready to die at the sight of me, thinking that he had only run from one danger to another, so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avoid me but that I prevented; he then fell on the ground, and taking hold of one of my feet, put his head on the earth and my foot upon it, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a token of his wish to be my servant, it turned out so, and a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, diligent fellow never lived; his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers soon gave him up, and returned to their own country.</p>
            <figure/>

            </figure>
            <p>The other four were Spaniards, all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, taken in war a few days before, by the savage nation, and their practice was to eat all those who fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>We were now seven in number, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fortunately an English merchant ship, homeward bound, was by contrary winds drove near our island; we made a large fire in the woods one night to convince the crew of the ship the island was inhabited;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:019599_0022_0FAC5F53C6F08128"/>
next morning twenty sailors came on shore well armed, we soon convinced them of our friendship, and treated them with the best the island produced; in return they gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously took us on board to Liverpool, from thence I went to York, but was greatly shocked at the news I received; my ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling disposition, I found had brought my dear father and mother to their graves; they both died soon after I left Hull.</p>
            <p>I cannot express the agony it now causes in me; I consider myself entirely as the author of their deaths and though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty sufficient is left for me to live like a gentleman, I cannot have peace to enjoy it; and at this moment I really believe myself the most miserable object living, and heartily I repent giving way to the restless disposition which made me leave my parents, as from that hour I date all the subsequent misfortunes of my life.</p>
            <p>Now as many of my readers, from a wild inclination of their own, or from the advice of bad children, may wish to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:019599_0023_0FAC5F5483E982B8"/>
from one country to another, they may rest assured by me, that it will only bring them into distress; for every word of my father's advice, when he called me into his chamber, I fatally found strictly to be true.</p>
